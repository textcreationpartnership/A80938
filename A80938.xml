         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Declaration of the Army</hi> wee have ſeen; Some godly Miniſters with us, did at <hi>Barwicke</hi> compoſe this reply, which I thought fit to ſend you. That you or we, in theſe great tranſactions, anſwer the will and mind of God: it is only from his grace and mercy to us, and therefore having ſaid (as in our papers) we commit the iſſue thereof to him who diſpoſeth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117396:3"/>all things; aſſuring you that we have light and comfort increaſing upon us day by day, and are perſwaded, that before it be long, the Lord will manifeſt his good pleaſure, ſo that all ſhall ſee him, and his people ſhall ſay, <hi>This is the Lords work, and it is marvellous in our eyes: This is the day that the Lord hath made, we will be glad and rejoyce therein</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely give me leave to ſay in a word, you take upon you to judge us in the things of our God, though you know us not; though in the things we have ſaid unto you (in that which is intituled the <hi>Armies Declaration</hi>) we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our hearts, as in the ſight of the Lord who hath tryed us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by your hard and ſubtle words you have begotten prejudice in thoſe who do too much (in matters of conſcience, wherein every ſoule is to anſwer for it ſelfe to God) depend upon you, ſo that ſome have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready followed you to the breathing out of their ſoules, others continue ſtill in the way wherein they are lead by you (we fear) to their owne ruine: and no marvell, if you deale thus with us, when indeed you can finde in your hearts to conceale the papers we have ſent you,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117396:3"/>from your own people, who might ſee and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the bowels of our affections to them, eſpecially ſuch among them as fear the Lord. Send as many of your papers as you pleaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ours, they have free paſſage, I feare them not; what is of God in them would it might be imbraced and received.</p>
            <p>One of them lately ſent, directed to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Officers and Souldiers in the Engliſh <hi>Army,</hi> hath begotten from them this incloſed <hi>Anſwer,</hi> which they deſired me to ſend you, not a crafty politique one, <hi>but a plaine ſimple ſpirituall one;</hi> ſuch as it is God knoweth, and God alſo will in due time make manifeſt, and do we multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe things as men? or doe we them for the Lord Chriſt and his peoples ſakes?</p>
            <p>Indeed we are not, through the grace of God, affraid of your numbers, nor confident in our ſelves We could (I pray God you do not think we boaſt) meet your <hi>Army,</hi> or what you have to bring againſt us. We have given (humbly we ſpeak it before our God, in whom all our hope is ſome proof, that thoughts of that kind prevaile not upon us. The Lord hath not hid his face from us ſince our approach ſo near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117396:4"/>you, your own guilt is too much for you to beare, bring not upon your ſelves the blood of Innocent men, deceived with pretences of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> from whoſe eyes you hide a better knowledge I am perſwaded that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of you, who lead the people have laboured to build your ſelves in theſe things, wherein you have cenſured others and eſtabliſhed your ſelves upon the Word of God. Is it therefore infallibly agreeable to the Word of God all that you ſay?</p>
            <p>I beſeech you in the bowels of Chriſt, think it poſſible you may be miſtaken: Precept may be upon Precept, Line may be upon line, &amp; yet the Word of the Lord may be to ſome a word of Judgement, that they may fall backward &amp; be broken, and be ſnared, and be taken: There may be a ſpirituall fullneſſe, which the world may call drunkenneſſe as in the ſecond of the Acts; there may be as well a carnall confidence, upon miſ-underſtood, and miſ-applyed Precepts, which may be called Spirituall Drunkenneſſe, There may be a <hi>Covenant made with Death and Hell,</hi> (I will not ſay yours was ſo) but judge if ſuch things have a politick aime, to avoide
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117396:4"/>the overflowing ſcourge, or to accompliſh worldly intereſts, and if therein we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with wicked and carnall men, and have reſpect, or otherwiſe drawn in to aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with us, whither this be a Covenant of God and ſpirituall bethink your ſelves, we hope we do. I pray you read the 28th of <hi>Eſaiah</hi> from the 5th, to the 15th. and do not ſcorn to know that it is the Spirit that quickens and giveth life, and the Lord give you and us underſtanding to do that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting you to the Grace of God I reſt,</p>
